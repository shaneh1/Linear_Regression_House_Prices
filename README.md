# Linear_Regression_House_Prices
Linear Regression with Stochastic Gradient Descent using Portland dataset to predict a house price based on two other features.
Developed this model as part of a college project. It reads in normalised data from the csv file. The model is trained on the Portland House Prices dataset.
The model uses Stochastic Gradient Descent, including hyperparameters for momentum and learning rate which can altered for optimum results.
The results are then compared against results obtained from standard python libraries.
